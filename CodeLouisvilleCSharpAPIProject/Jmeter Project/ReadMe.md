## The Website that I used for Jmeter Testing is www.demoblaze.com which is E-commerce Website.

For this performance testing I have used 50 user that will be iterate for 30 times. The Summary Report that I got after running signifies the number of samples
is 1500. By looking the Sample Report we can say that average response time is 58ms, whereas the fastest and slowest response time is 37ms and 729ms. The Graph Results
also shows that at the starting point the response time is blurry but as the number of user increased the average response time is 58ms which is consistent.
